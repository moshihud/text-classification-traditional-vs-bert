407179,32,"Pros: The ice maker is really efficient. And it gets more efficient after the first couple of batches. For my family purposes it is therefore more than enough. I did not find the ice to melt fast when kept in the bucket, but I have only used it inside my house during the fall so far.<br />Cons: I found it to be more noisy than what I expected from reading other reviews. It sounds like a fridge, though a small one. The other thing with which I was a little bit disappointed was the size of the ice. The small size is really small. The large one is acceptable though. A picture of a piece of ice that comes out when the large ice mode is selected is attached. And yes, it melts pretty fast, but I don't mind. It gets the drink cold, and I always put a lot of ice in my drinks anyway. I am accustomed to watery drinks. I am certain the other models available that use the same technology will have similar performance results.<br /><br />In summary, I would say it is worth the price.

77619,32,"The value is great for a filter that removes 13 contaminants including lead, chlorine, cysts, and certain pharmaceutical chemicals. There are 2 reasons why I did not give this a 5 star rating. 1) Removing the old Aquacrest filter was very difficult. I had cut off water supply to reduce pressure, and still could not turn the knob to unlock it. I used a wrench and that did the job!  The installation was very easy and I removed almost 3 gallons of water before taking a sip. However 2) the taste had a plastic flavor to it. Although it tastes better than tap water (no metalic or chlorine taste!) but there was a flavor that is similar to plastic (almost like drinking water from plastic bottle).

I wish I had bought it months earlier.  I love this thing.<br /><br />The adapter that came with it fit my kitchen faucet perfectly, so I was able to start using it within fifteen minutes of bringing it inside the house.<br /><br />It is small.  At most I can fit two pairs of jeans OR two bath towels (plus a t-shirt and socks, etc. for balance).  As a single guy, that's all I need.  In fact, I have a new-found love of doing small loads of laundry, since the smaller jobs are much less daunting.<br /><br />It takes up space in front of just one basin of my dual-basin kitchen sink, and I've hooked the drain hose to my dish rack to keep the hose from flopping around during the drain cycle.

21865,32,Love this range hood it was exactly what we were looking for. It comes in 3 pieces so you can cut the middle part down with a jig saw to fit your space and the crown molding will cover any uneven cuts. The fan vent is adjustable and flexable. The instal instructions are not great but still easy enough to figure out. If you are installing in drywall the main hood is very heavy.

However, within 5 months, the motor on the unit stopped working. It's now no longer operational. I contacted the seller here and they said that they won't replace the unit.

319626,32,"Not sure what to say about this pod. I have the Keurig 2.0 and I was constantly getting the “Ooops...” message when trying to use a refillable pod. When people use these large pods, what they need is for the full menu to come up when they’re inserted; instead most often you get the dreaded, “Ooops...” message. I want to brew 16-oz cups of pre-ground coffee in a travel cup; the only way to brew a cup that large is to use a large pod—but again, the large refillable pods usually give you the “Ooops...” message.  As a work-around, I’d use the magnetic circle from the lid of pre-filled k-carafe pods and cut them out and stick them to the reusable pod. It worked, but that became tedious and expensive because they eventually wore off. When my reusable pod broke, I tried this one.  The magnetic tape on it is a perfect solution to the dreaded “Ooops...” message as it brings up the full menu. That part was AWESOME!  However, it’s made of very cheap plastic. The hinge on the lid broke the first time I used it, and the male part of the lid cracked and fell apart when I was removing the coffee grounds after brewing. If it was made of a sturdier plastic, I’d give it a rounding 5-star review, but because it’s on the cheap-side, I only give 3-stars.

241123,32,"We needed to replace our almost worn out iCoffee iCups, which have been the most reliable, easy to clean and positive sealing lid reusable pods we have tried in the last 7 years. Unfortunately they are no longer available.<br /><br />After research and checking reviews we chose to try these pods, especially since they were closest in design and without the needle basket in the lid, which I prefer.<br /><br />Received the pods and scoop, the scoop which does work well once you develop your technique for it, and washed them first. They do appear more cheaply made than the iCups and also use a molded one piece design, the lid being attached to the basket by a thinner section functioning as the hinge. This cheaper design usually doesn't hold up to regular use for very long before the hinge will break, but that remains to be seen. Better quality pods like the iCups have an actual separate hinge that allow the lid to be removed for easier cleaning or replaced.<br /><br />All of that aside, of which I would have been willing to deal with, the deal breaker being the oversize of needle hole in the lid. The first use of the pod I put my regular amount of grounds in, which is about 1/4"" below the top. I like strong coffee but have found that tamping the grounds down to get more coffee in actually makes for a weaker cup as the water is not able to saturate the grounds as easily or as evenly. I have since found on other coffee sites that this is a known issue in the use of reusable pods. Also, if you overfill, as the grounds absorb water, they swell, which often results in a mess, coffee grounds being forced out of the lid edges or needle hole in the lid.<br /><br />That being said, at the first use, when opening the coffee maker lid I noticed a mess of water and grounds all over the top of the pod and underside of the maker lid. I thought I had overfilled the pod, but was sure I used the same amount I have regularly used with the iCups and other pods. So I actually lessened the normal amount another 1/8"" and tried again. Same results.<br /><br />After further examination I realized the problem. The needle hole in the pod lid was noticeably larger in diameter than my other pods, which allowed the water and grounds to spray out around the needle when the water was being sprayed into the pod. It took filling the pod to only half capacity to stop this mess from being made, totally unacceptable.

671609,32,"Very nice for a bachelor who only washes a small load most weeks. Even so, the wash load must be broken into at least 2 loads to spin &#34;dry&#34; (a damp dry, but a day on a rack finishes the job). The washer takes only 10-15 minutes to do it's work. I put the clothes into the spin dryer, pour a 5 gallon bucket of fresh water over them to rinse and then spin for 3-4 minutes. I usually finish 1-2 wash loads (and 4-5 &#34;dryer&#34; loads) in about an hour (except on sheets day once a month which adds 30 more minutes.) This little unit does the job just fine!  I've been using it for 9 weeks and it's proven so far.  Cheaper & easier than going to the laundromat!<br />Update September/2017: I note the dryer will not spin up if it is slow draining the rinse water. You might have to manhandle it to tip out the water. It is also temperamental about a balanced load. It can only do one pair of jeans at a time. But it remains a tough, dependable little workhorse after 3 months.<br />Update January/2020: Dryer has stopped working.  I used it every other week for one load wash and 2-3 dryer loads. That gives it a life of about 2.5 years. I'm not too disappointed as this is to be expected I guess as it is more for RVs and temporary use then my regular use.

563487,32,Probably the best decision ever. I was skeptical about it at first but after a week of doing laundry it changed my mind really quick. I was getting it for me and my girlfriend when we move in but I wanted to try it right away to see if it was all of that so I hooked it up at my parents house and now I have to get another one because I can't remove it now since they like it so much. But I have had this thing for a few months now and it works perfectly. I do have to add a little bit of laundry detergent just to get the really tuff stuff like grease and tar. I work in hvac so my clothes gets covered in all sorts of stuff but this thing gets rid of most types of scum. The laundry detergent isn't for smell it is to get rid of grease. The clothes come our smelling fresh all the time with this thing. All of my moldy towels smell and look fresh now from this thing.<br /><br />Edit: we just got a new front load washer and the effect of the ozone has dropped dramatically since there is not as much water usage on these new machines.

Unfortunately, instead of having one drip hole in the center of the unit, it has four!  Sadly, the photo of the cone doesn't show that.  Once you pour the water over the coffee in the paper filter, it drains immediately instead of slowly which results in a very weak cup of coffee. The other reason I went with this one was because the description said made in Holland, so in addition to looking like mine, I figured it would be crafted to a European standard.  Wrong!<br /><br />I'm very disappointed since I purposefully didn't bring back a duplicate of the one I had in France because being plastic I was afraid it would get broken in my luggage.

I also noticed that the coffee liquid not going into my cup was clear and not dark which seemed odd.  So after making a mess I tried to make sense of why this was happening and I figured it out.  I looked at the 1 piece filter and compared that to my old 3 piece filter and I noticed that the 3 piece filter had a giant hole for the hot water to drain into the filter and eventually into my cup.  I then looked at my new 1 piece filter and noticed that instead of one giant hole that it had many tiny holes but the holes are so small that liquid can only go so fast into the filter and thus the clear liquid began to overflow around my cup.  I did use ice pick and made those hole a few times bigger and that helped out a lot but I might even just cut the whole bottom for the best results.,5,1,first time used noticed coffee draining coffee cup going around cup cup also noticed coffee liquid going cup clear dark seemed odd making mess tried make sense happening figured looked piece filter compared old piece filter noticed piece filter giant hole hot water drain filter eventually cup looked new piece filter noticed instead one giant hole many tiny hole hole small liquid go fast filter thus clear liquid began overflow around cup use ice pick made hole time bigger helped lot might even cut whole bottom best result

I had to set my cooler at 45 degrees to achieve a temperature range in the low to mid 50's. There is a difference in temperature of about 4 degrees between the top shelf and the lower shelf. As Fall approaches and the ambient temperature is cooling, the readings are getting lower. This morning my lower shelf read 49 degrees.  My house only got down to about 64 degrees last night. Be sure you are placing the cooler somewhere with lots of ventilation. At first I placed it in a large walk in closet allowing plenty of space around it on all sides. The unit ran constantly, heated the closet, and never achieved a temp below the high 50s. Moving it into my office solved that problem but that was a disappointment because I wanted my wine out of sight. I have some nice Syrah that I wanted to keep cool. Those bottles would not fit on the regular shelves. By removing the bottom rack I was able to shove in 3 bottles. I could also get those bottles into the two outside spaces on the top shelf. I have had to work with it and make adjustments but it seems to be functioning reasonably well now. I may be unrealistic but for $300. I had hoped for better than reasonably well. I have had the unit for one month so I can't comment on how it will do over the long run.",5,5,first wine cooler basis comparison buy unit ignore temperature setting buy good digital thermometer set cooler degree achieve temperature range low mid difference temperature degree top shelf lower shelf fall approach ambient temperature cooling reading getting lower morning lower shelf read degree house got degree last night sure placing cooler somewhere lot ventilation first placed large walk closet allowing plenty space around side unit ran constantly heated closet never achieved temp high moving office solved problem disappointment wanted wine sight nice syrah wanted keep cool bottle would fit regular shelf removing bottom rack able shove bottle could also get bottle two outside space top shelf work make adjustment seems functioning reasonably well may unrealistic hoped better reasonably well unit one month comment long run
73565,32,"My Kitchenaid refirgerator came with an Everydrop EDR2XRD1 filter origianlly, about 6 months ago.  So, when I seaarched for a replacement filter, I used that PN, and came up with this Everydrop filter, whcih looks EXACTLY like the original one, and many others.  The others were SIGNIFICANTLY less expensive, as in about a third the price, but they were only rated at 05 GPM vs the 0.75 GPM of our original filter.  I drink a LOT of filtered water from our fridge, so I was willing to pay a premium for a flow rate of 50% higher.  The filter arrived today, and it is a PN E2RSXRD1/EDR2XRD1B.  It looks like the exact same filter, but is only rated at 0.6 GPM flow rate.  The other Everydrop listing stated 0.75 GPM but I do not see it on this listing.

I had to use tin snips and cut/bend the steel to move it into the correct position.

To replace this element you simply remove the wires from the back of the element and 2 screws 2 to remove the old one. You can either remove the wires from the inside of the oven or simply pull the oven out remove the access panel and pull the wires off the element. I tried doing this from the inside the oven and the wires fell back behind. I had to pull out the oven and remove the access panel to get to the wires. If I had to replace this again I would simply pull the oven out and move the access panel it was a lot easier to remove and attach the wires.,4,1,overall pretty easy repair like could easily see somebody charging repair element replace element simply remove wire back element screw remove old one either remove wire inside oven simply pull oven remove access panel pull wire element tried inside oven wire fell back behind pull oven remove access panel get wire replace would simply pull oven move access panel lot easier remove attach wire

After installing I waited a day and then soaked the area using a hose.  Water poured into the inside of the duct.  This means that the flashing was good and I had properly flashed it to keep water from getting under the flange and around the duct hole.  The problem is that the uphill seam on this are not soldered or sealed in any way.  Water seeped in through the bottom seam along the uphill side, into a small gutter around the 6 inch vent, and then down the vent hole.  I could not believe how poorly it was designed/manufactured.  I didn't want to remove roofing and pull the nails, so I sealed the uphill seam with silicon and put a piece of aluminum flashing along the seam to protect the silicon.  DO NOT BUY THIS.

89529,32,"[[VIDEOID:d2d53ff7b9468ca5990500550dc3b74e]] I got this countertop ice maker because I was tired of never having ice in the house when I wanted it.  It seemed like it would be the perfect solution to the problem I had and I was excited to get it set up and start using it.<br /><br />The ice maker comes with an ice basket, an ice scoop, and bags to put the ice inside of.  One of the biggest things I'd overlooked was the fact that this will not store and hold the ice.  If you leave the ice in the basket it just melts into the water again.  I hadn't realized that prior to ordering it, though it does say so in the product description.<br /><br />The unit itself is really good quality and doesn't take up any more space than other countertop appliances.  It's about the same size as our air fryer.  The unit is easy to use and understand.  There's a max fill line inside and a control panel on the top.  The lid is in front of the panel where the water goes and the basket is inserted.<br /><br />It takes quite a while for the unit to cool down and start producing ice.  The ice builds up on the metal rods in the back of the machine.  Once they're the correct thickness they drop into the machine and a plastic arm lifts them over the center and into the basket.  Even after the unit had been running for a long time it still took longer than the 6-13 minutes for the ice to dump into the basket.<br /><br />This system is far from efficient.  I had to keep getting up and taking the ice out and adding it to the bag.  After a couple of hours, I didn't even have half a bag of ice.  I realize this is more convenient for some than going out and buying a bag of ice or waiting for a tray in the freezer to be ready, but it just takes so long and doesn't produce enough ice to be worth my time.  For the energy I'm using to make the ice, I could have bought a 5 lb bag and called it good.<br /><br />I can see this being handy if you don't have a freezer or you're trying to use it for an event, but I'm having a really hard time understanding how this is better or easier than either buying ice or making it with a tray in the freezer.  Maybe I was too hopeful about what this product would do but it just takes too long and is too much of a hassle for me to continue using.",4,5,videoidddffbcadcbe got countertop ice maker tired never ice house wanted seemed like would perfect solution problem excited get set start using ice maker come ice basket ice scoop bag put ice inside one biggest thing would overlooked fact store hold ice leave ice basket melt water realized prior ordering though say product description unit really good quality take space countertop appliance size air fryer unit easy use understand max fill line inside control panel top lid front panel water go basket inserted take quite unit cool start producing ice ice build metal rod back machine correct thickness drop machine plastic arm lift center basket even unit running long time still took longer minute ice dump basket system far efficient keep getting taking ice adding bag couple hour even half bag ice realize convenient going buying bag ice waiting tray freezer ready take long produce enough ice worth time energy using make ice could bought lb bag called good see handy freezer trying use event really hard time understanding better easier either buying ice making tray freezer maybe hopeful product would take long much hassle continue using

279990,32,"Very, very pleased.  This works so much better than the original.  It doesn't have extraneous parts to fall off like the other one.  It makes ice significantly faster than the old one too.  In addition, the pieces of ice are smooth and pretty clear instead of with sharp edges and ice chips falling off.  It was a little tricky to install since we have french door model and didn't know how to remove the bottom drawer.  Thus it was hard to reach in and under to make the connection and screw the screws.  If the drawer had been out, installing this would have been a snap.

Easy with two people (especially holding it in place to mark the screw holes).<br /><br />We had no issues getting the label-goop off (though we used naptha straightaway after reading others' comments).<br /><br />The power is very good - it really moves a lot of air. On low, it'll take 100% of the steam from aggressive boiling water on the front burner. We like that you can turn on and off the fan without affecting the light. In other words, you can turn on the light, then turn on the fan, then turn off the fan (light's still on), then finally turn off the light. The only thing we'd change is the beep (every button press makes a small beep sound). It doesn't add anything or seem necessary. It's not terribly loud, just unnecessary, and if you want to turn on the light at night, you can't do so silently. Otherwise, it's great, all-around.

103080,32,"[[VIDEOID:4d2ac93d0ad9d4cd99f4af1cdde72958]] I'm putting together a quick-and-dirty rec room in our basement so the kids have someplace to watch TV and play video games.  I was given a couple of kitchen cabinets and small section of countertop, so I put a little ""kitchenette"" in the corner with a mini fridge and microwave.  But, it's ""dry"" - there's no sink or running water, and the mini fridge keeps drinks more in the ""slightly cool"" range, as opposed to actually ""cold"".  So I decided to try one of these countertop ice makers to provide ice in the event that some guests come over.<br /><br />I like the compact size and the fact it doesn't seem to use much power.  I plugged it in and added water (after waiting a day, per the instructions), hit the button, and... nothing.  The ""add water"" light came on - but I had filled it up pretty close to the ""max"" line?  OK, I added another half a bottle of water.  It started pumping the water up and 10 minutes or so later I had ice!<br /><br />It's kinda handy, but not without it's problems:  It's LOUD.  Louder than I expecting something this size could be, especially when it's pumping the water at the start of the cycle.  And even when it's just running, the fan is powerful enough that I can sense the vibration from a few feet away.  The machine doesn't actually refrigerate the ice holding area, so if you don't use the ice at a pretty good clip, it melts.  There's always a bit of water left in the holding area, so I have to carry the whole unit upstairs to drain and dry it after an evening of using it.  It needs to be refilled often - You'd quickly fall behind if you had more than 3 or 4 people using this throughout the course of an evening.<br /><br />Overall it's a better option than nothing, or if you entertain a lot it's better than buying a bag of ice every time you host guests.  And it would probably be a lot more handy if you're planning on keeping it on your kitchen counter right next to your sink, so you could fill or drain it at will.  I'm glad to have it as a backup for occasional gatherings, camping trips, power outages, etc., but I don't know if I'd consider it a ""use it day in and day out"" kind of item.",5,3,videoiddacdaddcdfafcdde putting together quickanddirty rec room basement kid someplace watch tv play video game given couple kitchen cabinet small section countertop put little kitchenette corner mini fridge microwave dry sink running water mini fridge keep drink slightly cool range opposed actually cold decided try one countertop ice maker provide ice event guest come like compact size fact seem use much power plugged added water waiting day per instruction hit button nothing add water light came filled pretty close max line ok added another half bottle water started pumping water minute later ice kind handy without problem loud louder expecting something size could especially pumping water start cycle even running fan powerful enough sense vibration foot away machine actually refrigerate ice holding area use ice pretty good clip melt always bit water left holding area carry whole unit upstairs drain dry evening using need refilled often would quickly fall behind people using throughout course evening overall better option nothing entertain lot better buying bag ice every time host guest would probably lot handy planning keeping kitchen counter right next sink could fill drain glad backup occasional gathering camping trip power outage etc know would consider use day day kind item

516031,32,"Overall, this is a good product. It's made of good material that look sturdy, flexible and durable. But a word of advice: when they say it is compatible with 1"" diamenter hose connection, it means the INNER diameter of your machine's end. If the OUTER diameter of your machine's end is exactly 1"" then the hose's end should be less than 1"" (its inner diameter). I had to wrap electrical tape around the machine's connection to make it thicker because it was loosen no matter how much I tightened the clamp.",4,2,overall good product made good material look sturdy flexible durable word advice say compatible diamenter hose connection mean inner diameter machine end outer diameter machine end exactly hose end less inner diameter wrap electrical tape around machine connection make thicker loosen matter much tightened clamp

541215,32,"Broke in less that 6 months, but was nice while it lasted.<br />_____<br /><br />UPDATE:  After the six months, I realized that by changing the setting from large to medium, it would still make ice.  It lasted another three months and then died.  NewAir was great about replacing it.  I sent in the old one, and had a brand-new one a few days later.<br /><br />To be fair, we ran the unit 24x7 the whole time we had it, and we go through 20+ pounds of ice a day.  I'm expecting the replacement unit to last about a year under the same conditions.  So if you do the math, this really is a bargain.  If I get 18 months of service from the two units, I would have purchased 540 bags of ice at roughly $3/bag, for a total of $1620.  Instead, I get the same amount of ice for $180 (plus the cost of RO water & electricity) and no need to lug ice home from the store!<br /><br />With regard to cleaning:  This unit needs to be sanitized every couple of months.  I found that white vinegar in a spray bottle works great. Spray the inside, let it sit, and then rinse it out.  I then refill the unit with about a cup of vinegar and run it through a tank of water.  One more clean tank of water, the vinegar taste is gone, and the machine is sanitized.<br /><br />____<br /><br />Update 7/3/17 - My replacement unit died today.  Functioned as expected, lasting a little less than a year.  It's clear that the manufacturer sells this exact unit to multiple brands with custom badging.  I'm going to buy this same unit from one of the other brands here on Amazon and keep the NewAir around for spare parts...  If you go this route and use the machine daily, expect to get 9-12 months out of it, and buy the 4 year replacement plan!",1,2,broke less month nice lasted _____ update six month realized changing setting large medium would still make ice lasted another three month died newair great replacing sent old one brandnew one day later fair ran unit x whole time go pound ice day expecting replacement unit last year condition math really bargain get month service two unit would purchased bag ice roughly bag total instead get amount ice plus cost ro water electricity need lug ice home store regard cleaning unit need sanitized every couple month found white vinegar spray bottle work great spray inside let sit rinse refill unit cup vinegar run tank water one clean tank water vinegar taste gone machine sanitized ____ update replacement unit died today functioned expected lasting little less year clear manufacturer sell exact unit multiple brand custom badging going buy unit one brand amazon keep newair around spare part go route use machine daily expect get month buy year replacement plan
308998,32,"WARNING: Be aware that not ALL Keurig and K-compatible machines can use these? They are the larger 'carafe' size, i.e. they only fit inside machines that support it.<br /><br />And I mean 'freedom of choice', of course. This reusable K-cups set, provided by vendor as a 'for review' item, makes me a lot happier about keeping a Keurig machine on our kitchen counter because I was seriously thinking of demoting it to the garage.<br /><br />After more than 2 months of happy daily use more than once daily of [[ASIN:B00W8MO0UO Fill N Save 3 Pack Reusable K-Cups for Keurig 2.0 & Backward Compatible With Original Keurig 1.0 Models]], I would say that they did pass the test of durability because they are as good today as they were more than 2 months ago. I can't state for a fact these reusable K-cups are as durable because I've only tried them for a couple of days now but, them coming from the same vendor and being of a more or less similar design, the odds are that they are as good as that other model and therefore are likely to save you lots of money in the long run.<br /><br />Yes, the Keurig's idea is interesting because you can have coffee or tea very much instantly and you don't need to worry much about cleaning up before or after, other than throwing away the used cup. My issues with the method is that I must rely on someone else making a specific flavor available and if nobody does it the way I want it then... tough luck and, of course, the price. I was using the Keurig machine mostly for tea and the prices of those tea pods was bordering 'outrageous'.<br /><br />But... enter the 'reusable' rebel movement. Yeah, I know, orange but who's looking? The cups are truly reusable. Yes, I do have to clean them even though for tea, it's actually not a bad idea to sometime add fresh tea leaves on top of the recently used old ones but I digress. So some cleaning is required. On the other hand, I can have my tea or my coffee exactly the way I want them and that's priceless.<br /><br />As far as 'quality', see second paragraph. I know that they are not going to last forever because they are 'plastic' and there is a sealing rubber ring around the top but I suspect that they are going to last long enough to save me some serious money and always save me the frustration of not having my brew the way I want it.",5,5,warning aware keurig kcompatible machine use larger carafe size ie fit inside machine support mean freedom choice course reusable kcups set provided vendor review item make lot happier keeping keurig machine kitchen counter seriously thinking demoting garage month happy daily use daily asinbwmouo fill n save pack reusable kcups keurig backward compatible original keurig model would say pas test durability good today month ago state fact reusable kcups durable tried couple day coming vendor less similar design odds good model therefore likely save lot money long run yes keurigs idea interesting coffee tea much instantly need worry much cleaning throwing away used cup issue method must rely someone else making specific flavor available nobody way want tough luck course price using keurig machine mostly tea price tea pod bordering outrageous enter reusable rebel movement yeah know orange looking cup truly reusable yes clean even though tea actually bad idea sometime add fresh tea leaf top recently used old one digress cleaning required hand tea coffee exactly way want priceless far quality see second paragraph know going last forever plastic sealing rubber ring around top suspect going last long enough save serious money always save frustration brew way want

239507,32,"I waited to post this review until I had a chance to use this ice maker.  I have used it in my RV a lot the past two months.

348397,32,"I bought the 7.7 lb version to wash cloth face masks more frequently than I can in the full size clothes washer. I'm surprised how much it can hold, easily 50-100 face masks. Most of the time I wash 10 at most, which this can handle without breaking a sweat.<br /><br />The instructions are sparse and not very clear. I first put the laundry in the spin basket and put it on wash cycle. Predictably it failed by throwing the basket off the agitator. My mistake. The wash cycle spins both ways, but the basket is designed to hold only in one spin direction. Put the clothes directly in the basin without the spin basket. It stirs up the clothes as well as a full size washer.<br /><br />It's a manual process of draining the basin after the wash cycle, refilling for rinse, then drain again after. The included fill hose doesn't fit my standard faucet, so I have to find an adapter of some sort. I manually fill using a mini bucket.<br /><br />The spin cycle requires the spin basket (duh!). It's challenging to arrange the clothes so it's well balanced. Usually it wobbles like crazy and makes the unit shift around. With some experimentation I've figured out how to balance the load relatively well. The spinner does a good job drying the clothes. Not as good as the full size washer which spins much faster, but it's good enough. It wrings out as much water as hand wringing, with the benefit of not leaving wrinkles and stressing the fabric.<br /><br />Overall this is a great product for small loads. Set your expectations accordingly. It requires more manual intervention than a full size clothes washer. It sure beats hand washing masks though. It's also 1/10 the price, can fit on a countertop, and is easily stored away.<br /><br />Update: on the 3rd use, I thought it stopped working. The timer would tick but motor wouldn't engage. Turns out it has an over temp protection circuit. If it runs too long and gets hot inside, the over temp protection kicks in and you have to wait til it cools down.

512203,32,"My front-load washer and dryer are both fairly large, and while they do a great job on my clothes, I found that if I washed a large or dense load (like a bunch of towels) the machines would take on a life of their own: wobbling, shaking, scooting…  We’re talking scooting that would put my dog to shame.  And no, I was not overloading the machines.  It’s amazing how far a large front-load washer can travel on a hard tiled floor, and I figured if I didn’t find a solution soon I might come home one day to find my washing machine in my living room.<br /><br />I searched for something I could put beneath the washer and dryer to keep them in place.  Most mats designed for this purpose had mediocre reviews, but then I stumbled on these little “hockey pucks” and took a chance on them since their reviews were fairly positive.  They have been nothing short of amazing.  I put one of these discs beneath each foot of the two machines, and since then the washer and dryer have remained firmly planted to the floor.  In 15 months they have not budged even an inch.<br /><br />If you look at my photo, you can see that these discs are quite substantial, and they seem to be made of a very heavy and dense rubber.  They aren’t adhesive or particularly tacky, but they do seem to provide enough traction with the floor (probably helped by the weight of the machines) to keep the washer and dryer from moving.<br /><br />Here’s a big tip: While these discs do a nice job of preventing my machines from relocating themselves, they do NOT address the “shaking” problem.  Even with these discs in place, if I washed a heavy load the machines would still rock back and forth -- this is probably made worse because they are both elevated few feet off the ground.  To cut down on the shaking I used sheets of Dynamat, which are basically heavy adhesive sheets.  I stuck three sheets to each side of my washer and two to each side of my dryer and they really cut down on the shaking.

699396,32,"Many of the reviews of this and other similar products complain about the non-stainless blades which will rust and fail after a relatively short period of time.  I agree with those reviewers.  OEM products WITH stainless blades will cost 2-3 times more money and last years and years. I did buy this cheap one with the intention of swapping out the blades (my original blades which look brand new after years of use) for the cheap ""will rust"" ones) and I did so.  After a few months all appears OK.  It's a bit of work swapping the blades and definitely NOT for everyone.  I do believe these cheap ones WILL work until the blades rust out - how long that is probably depends on many things including dishwasher usage and water type (hard, soft, city, well, etc).

309845,32,"Only had this ice machine for a week, but love it so far. Lacks a couple of key features that would REALLY make this a stand out product. The ice maker has an app, but other than to use it for turning the ice maker off or turning off the little night light that is built in, the app is not much use. Would be REALLY GOOD if the App would notify you when the machine has shut down so ice won't sit there and melt if you happen not to get back to it to check for a while.<br /><br />When you fill it up and first turn it on, it runs for about 15 minutes before it starts making ice. Then it drops out really slowly for the first 45 to 60 minutes. Filling up the reservoir, (about 7 cups of water) takes about 3 hours to 3:15 to fill up the ice bin and shut off. Now that I've run through several cycles, I know to set the alarm on my phone to go back and check it after 3 hours.<br /><br />Makes great ice... just like many restaurants serve.

448551,32,"My LG washing machine (from 2007 or 2008) began making unhappy noises that were getting worse.  A little research indicated that it was almost certainly one or more of the drum rollers.  (One of the front ones, it turned out, clearly had a bearing that was failing pretty badly).  I decided to give this kit a try because it was much cheaper than buying the OEM replacements from a specialty appliance site, as this kit includes all four rollers as well as the belt, idler pulley, and spring.  I replaced all four rollers and the belt, but didn't touch the idler pulley or spring.  The rollers seem to be very well-made and were identical to the OEM parts.  The only oddity is that you need two (2) washers and a nut for each roller, and this kit only includes one, so you'll need to use one of the original ones.  I ended up re-using all of the original washers and nut, simply because they seemed larger and maybe a tiny bit thicker than the ones that came with this kit.  That's the only reason I only gave 4 stars for the rating.  The repair was pretty easy (most of my time was spent removing dust and lint), and the reassembled washer is now as quiet as the day we first bought it.  I can't vouch for the longevity, (again, the rollers seem well-made and solidly constructed) but I'm very happy with this kit so far.",4,3,lg washing machine began making unhappy noise getting worse little research indicated almost certainly one drum roller one front one turned clearly bearing failing pretty badly decided give kit try much cheaper buying oem replacement specialty appliance site kit includes four roller well belt idler pulley spring replaced four roller belt touch idler pulley spring roller seem wellmade identical oem part oddity need two washer nut roller kit includes one need use one original one ended reusing original washer nut simply seemed larger maybe tiny bit thicker one came kit reason gave star rating repair pretty easy time spent removing dust lint reassembled washer quiet day first bought vouch longevity roller seem wellmade solidly constructed happy kit far

398653,32,"Watch the video review for this product.  It's really quite helpful and will give you ideas on how you can get a system going that works for you.  If you buy this, get a system you can live with.  As much as I encourage looking at someone else's review, here's my 2 cents.<br /><br />Key points:<br />*The hoses are short, particularly the drain hose.  Where you use this has to be within several feet of an outlet, a couple feet of a water source and pretty much right next to where you want to drain it.  You can get around the hose length by using a bucket to add water (fill the bucket in a sink or tub and pour water in - the machine is indifferent to how the water is added, since that's a manual process anyway - the hose is a suggestion, not a requirement) or drain into a bucket or tub.  Using buckets involves lifting a couple gallons of water a few times during the process, so sinks and drains are far more convenient.  If you have the included hose too taut, it's more likely to pull off of the faucet, and that means water all over the place.  I end up putting it in front of my bathroom sink and drain it into the toilet, as the tub is just too far away from the sink to make it convenient otherwise.<br />*You need to put it on something.  It uses gravity to drain and the drain hose is at the bottom.  I use a side table purchased for $12.  It's rated for 30 pounds, which technically this is going to exceed when in use, but the weight is evenly distributed and shouldn't cause even a cheap little table to collapse.  Elevating this by too much might make it harder to use for shorter folks (might be hard to reach in to get things if it's on an actual counter), but leaving it really low could cause some back strain.  Find a cost effective and comfortable height that fits YOU, and remember that you'll have to interact with it a few times per load.<br />*You may find it stretches some of your clothes out or causes some items to pill.  Use laundry delicates bags.  They sell them in various sizes, and you want to use one big enough to let the garment move around, or put a few articles in the same bag.  If you use a spin dryer, you can put them in the dryer still in the bags or take them out.<br />*There's no magic rinse cycle or spin cycle like on full sized washing machines.  You drain and refill or rinse separately (you can do a few loads of wash in the same water if you'd like to - I don't pay for water where I live and we're not in anything close to a drought, so I'm okay with using a little bit more detergent to use fresh water every time).  I typically run with detergent for the full 15 minutes, drain completely, refill completely to rinse (I may let it sit in the rinse water for a few minutes or even run the machine for 5 minutes or so if I think the clothes are more likely to retain detergent), drain again, and then have a second rinse with fabric softener if I choose to use it, during which I run the machine for 3-5 minutes to make sure it's distributed evenly.  After the final drain, I wring each item out and then finish off in a spin dryer then hang to dry for a few hours.  I keep a cheap colander with the laundry stuff to use to hold items between rinsing and putting them in the spin dryer, and have also used it for rinsing items that I pulled out before I put the fabric softener in.  It lets things drip dry a little bit, which helps prevent unbalanced loads in the spin dryer.<br />*Capacity is several small items, or one larger item with really small items.  I've washed full sized sheets (flat in one load, fitted in another).  Adult pants can be washed with other things, depending on size (I'm a ladies 12 and I can get some shirts in the same load).  A bath towel is a large item.  Socks and other things like that can always go in with a large item.  You can fill as much as can move decently well in the water, with the water level about 2/3 up.  If you fill it more, it might splash out the drain hose.<br /><br />Laundry is more involved than tossing in the washer and then in the dryer, but it's more convenient for those of us who can't have full sized machines.  It's not too loud, but it's not silent.  The timer ticks, the motor isn't super loud, but you can certainly hear it, and the water sloshes around when it spins.  It's probably comparable to the dishwasher in my apartment, maybe slightly less noisy (my dishwasher is loud, though).  This may be TMI, but I use reusable menstrual pads and it got one of those completely clean (after a pre-rinse under running water), so it certainly cleans sufficiently.  I'm not running to the bank to get several rolls of quarters and can do laundry when I feel like it, not when my neighbors don't feel like doing their laundry (or just leaving their laundry in the machines...).",3,5,watch video review product really quite helpful give idea get system going work buy get system live much encourage looking someone elses review cent key point hose short particularly drain hose use within several foot outlet couple foot water source pretty much right next want drain get around hose length using bucket add water fill bucket sink tub pour water machine indifferent water added since manual process anyway hose suggestion requirement drain bucket tub using bucket involves lifting couple gallon water time process sink drain far convenient included hose taut likely pull faucet mean water place end putting front bathroom sink drain toilet tub far away sink make convenient otherwise need put something us gravity drain drain hose bottom use side table purchased rated pound technically going exceed use weight evenly distributed even cheap little table collapse elevating much might make harder use shorter folk might hard reach get thing actual counter leaving really low could cause back strain find cost effective comfortable height fit remember interact time per load may find stretch clothes cause item pill use laundry delicates bag sell various size want use one big enough let garment move around put article bag use spin dryer put dryer still bag take magic rinse cycle spin cycle like full sized washing machine drain refill rinse separately load wash water would like pay water live anything close drought okay using little bit detergent use fresh water every time typically run detergent full minute drain completely refill completely rinse may let sit rinse water minute even run machine minute think clothes likely retain detergent drain second rinse fabric softener choose use run machine minute make sure distributed evenly final drain wring item finish spin dryer hang dry hour keep cheap colander laundry stuff use hold item rinsing putting spin dryer also used rinsing item pulled put fabric softener let u thing drip dry little bit help prevent unbalanced load spin dryer capacity several small item one larger item really small item washed full sized sheet flat one load fitted another adult pant washed thing depending size lady get shirt load bath towel large item sock thing like always go large item fill much move decently well water water level fill might splash drain hose laundry involved tossing washer dryer convenient u full sized machine loud silent timer tick motor super loud certainly hear water sloshes around spin probably comparable dishwasher apartment maybe slightly less noisy dishwasher loud though may tmi use reusable menstrual pad got one completely clean prerinse running water certainly clean sufficiently running bank get several roll quarter laundry feel like neighbor feel like laundry leaving laundry machine

I was a little nervous at first shipping something that could so easily be damaged, however it came in perfect condition and the freight handlers could not have been better. The fridge is expensive but it was the only one on the market that I could find that could maintain the temperature you set it at. It doesn’t feel cheaply made when you open and close the door as other models felt. Some reviewers complained about the noise, it does run through a short cycle but I don’t find the noise to be overly loud or bothersome. My husband has also not complained about the noise. We’ve had no issues with it so far. As a warning, this fridge is a smidge taller than a standard cabinet so you need to take that into consideration when building it in.

441605,32,"I have high expectations for a washer because I use cloth diapers on my children.  I was extremely happy with my previous traditional Kenmore Elite which did a fabulous job of getting diapers and clothes clean.  When the agitator quit working the repair job was going to be a few hundred dollars less than new, so we thought we'd go with new.  I wish I had spent the money on the repair.<br /><br />I did lots of research and felt the GE was the best of old school and new.  I wanted a top loader to be able to soak, but I did not want a locking lid.  I wanted an agitator and I also wanted to be able to control the water level and the temperature.  Despite the HE components like auto sense load and auto temp, this machine still lets you choose the water level so I thought I made the best choice.  I also thought it was a great price compared to the new fancy machines with all the bells and whistles that I don't need in order to do a simple task like laundry.<br /><br />When it was installed and I washed my first load, I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was.  After a few loads however, it started making a bad squeaking sound that I knew was not normal.  The big blue home improvment store that we bought it from was excellent about coming to replace it quickly.  I could have chosen another machine, but I still felt this one had all the features that I wanted so I just got another one.<br /><br />After a few more loads I had to figure out how to make the machine do what I really wanted it to do.  Because of new government restrictions, hot is barely tepid.  To get the machine to fill with all hot water from the water heater without getting diluted by cold water, I have to leave the lid up.  The downside to this is if I forget to put the lid down, the load never starts.  I've gotten use to it, but everyone once in awhile I forget long enough that the water cools down and I have to start all over.  It's ridiculous to me.  Hot should mean hot.  I HAVE to wash diapers on hot and their version of hot is completely unacceptable.<br /><br />To get the water level I want, I have to set the dial one to two loads above what I think it is.  Large is really more like medium so if I fill the tub up with clothes, I have to select super to get as much water as I want.  Don't change the dial while it's filling up because then the tub empties all the water and starts all over.  Sort of defeats the water saving feature if you ask me.<br /><br />So all of this was inconvenient and maybe annoying, but if it was cleaning clothes then I figured I could live with it.  Wrong again.  I was use to basic food or playground stains coming out with a little pre-treatment or something.  Not with this machine.  I have to put something through at least twice and I'm still not sure that the stain will come out.  I've also had items like gym clothes that come out still smelling like sweat or a mixture of detergent and sweat.  Yeah, gross.<br /><br />It also cannot handle delicates.  With my previous machine I could put in items that said hand wash and they would came out clean and in good shape.  This machine leaves holes at the seam line in clothes that say to wash on gentle despite chosing the delicate cycle.  I've also noticed that many of my kitchen towels and bath towels are starting to shred at the ends.  Granted I've had some of these towels for years but I find it odd they ALL starting fraying after we got this machine.<br /><br />The final straw with this machine is that it does not rinse well.  My kids are not overly sensitive to detergents, but I've noticed that they have been scratching or are otherwise irriated after we've had this machine.  I've noticed a difference for myself too.  The biggest tell-tell sign is with diapers.  It is very important that diapers are rinsed well so that leftover detergent doesn't irritate baby's skin potentially leading to a rash.  Even when using the second rinse feature, or the fabric softener option, diapers are NEVER rinsed well.  I can smell the detergent when I pull them out.  And yes, I am using HE detergent.  I've tried powders and liquids and the results are the same.  I can run a load of diapers without new detergent and suds will float to the top of the water.  To get my diapers as clean as they should be I have to run at least 3 hot loads while manually scooping out the suds.  Consequently, I have grown to loathe this machine.<br /><br />Now that we are expecting a third child I MUST have a machine that can handle cloth diapers. With three little ones, I will not have time to babysit this machine and scoop out suds.  My wish list is still the same so the search continues.  If you need a machine to do some heavy duty cleaning, keep looking.  This machine can only handle ligth weight laundry and even then I'm not sure I would recommend it.",5,3,high expectation washer use cloth diaper child extremely happy previous traditional kenmore elite fabulous job getting diaper clothes clean agitator quit working repair job going hundred dollar less new thought would go new wish spent money repair lot research felt ge best old school new wanted top loader able soak want locking lid wanted agitator also wanted able control water level temperature despite component like auto sense load auto temp machine still let u choose water level thought made best choice also thought great price compared new fancy machine bell whistle need order simple task like laundry installed washed first load pleasantly surprised quiet load however started making bad squeaking sound knew normal big blue home improvment store bought excellent coming replace quickly could chosen another machine still felt one feature wanted got another one load figure make machine really wanted new government restriction hot barely tepid get machine fill hot water water heater without getting diluted cold water leave lid downside forget put lid load never start gotten use everyone awhile forget long enough water cool start ridiculous hot mean hot wash diaper hot version hot completely unacceptable get water level want set dial one two load think large really like medium fill tub clothes select super get much water want change dial filling tub empty water start sort defeat water saving feature ask inconvenient maybe annoying cleaning clothes figured could live wrong use basic food playground stain coming little pretreatment something machine put something least twice still sure stain come also item like gym clothes come still smelling like sweat mixture detergent sweat yeah gross also handle delicates previous machine could put item said hand wash would came clean good shape machine leaf hole seam line clothes say wash gentle despite chosing delicate cycle also noticed many kitchen towel bath towel starting shred end granted towel year find odd starting fraying got machine final straw machine rinse well kid overly sensitive detergent noticed scratching otherwise irriated machine noticed difference biggest telltell sign diaper important diaper rinsed well leftover detergent irritate baby skin potentially leading rash even using second rinse feature fabric softener option diaper never rinsed well smell detergent pull yes using detergent tried powder liquid result run load diaper without new detergent suds float top water get diaper clean run least hot load manually scooping suds consequently grown loathe machine expecting third child must machine handle cloth diaper three little one time babysit machine scoop suds wish list still search continues need machine heavy duty cleaning keep looking machine handle ligth weight laundry even sure would recommend

147042,32,"Installed easily and worked like a champ. I have intermediate handyman skills, nothing advanced. But I was able to figure out what was wrong and figured it was worth a try. I thought it might be the gas valve at first because the old igniter was glowing red hot. But I read further and learned that igniters start getting weak over time. Mine was about 10 years old. If it is too weak it won't open the gas valve. That is a pretty smart design if you ask me. You only want gas to go into the oven if it is going to ignite and that is what the igniter/gas valve work together to do. The clue that my old igniter was bad was that I didn't smell gas when I turned the oven on even though the igniter was glowing red (but it wasn't glowing hot enough anymore). So, it cost me some time to figure all that out but I saved some money because I did it myself.",5,4,installed easily worked like champ intermediate handyman skill nothing advanced able figure wrong figured worth try thought might gas valve first old igniter glowing red hot read learned igniter start getting weak time mine year old weak open gas valve pretty smart design ask want gas go oven going ignite ignitergas valve work together clue old igniter bad smell gas turned oven even though igniter glowing red glowing hot enough anymore cost time figure saved money
